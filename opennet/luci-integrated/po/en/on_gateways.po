Any Change of your Gateway will drop all your Internet Connections.<br />If non of the Gateways in your list are reachable or working (of if your list is empty), OpenVPN is deactivated. <br />Automated Gateway Search: The Gateways will be detected by an internal algorithm and ordered by their distance. In special cases this might nit be the best solution.<br/><br/>Additional Information about the column-values.<br/>If any Gateway is active, then the test-connection to the OpenVPN-Service of this server was successfull. If this information is missing, the test was not done before"
