    <ul>
      <li><%: Connecting your local neighbourhood with the complete mesh of all Opennet nodes. %></li>
      <li><%: Allowing certain public services to be reachable within your local neighbourhood. The most notable example is the Internet Gateway Service which is used by all people accesing the Internet via Opennet. %></li>
